The **3D Printing** (3DP) team at UTRA is dedicated to designing and manufacturing modular and robust 3D printers. 3D printing technology transforms 3D CAD models into physical objects.

**Regular Meetings:** Every Monday from 7PM to 9PM in the UTRA Lab (EA106)

**Join us** on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/170063056765640/) or contact us via [email](mailto:3dp@utra.ca)!

Having already designed a line up of miniature 3D printers from recycled components, the team intends on applying their learning to create a larger printer in the upcoming year. The 3D printing team additionally offers 3D printing services for the entire UTRA team, and the general UofT student population. The inclusion of 3D printed parts in the UTRA robot designs has enabled UTRA to accelerate the pace of our robot design and development strategy.

Last year, the team assembled a working 3D printer kit. It is capable of printing PLA parts on its 120 x 180 mm bed.

New team members can expect to learn how to efficiently create CAD models for engineering projects, properly operate a 3D printer, and skillfully manufacture modular 3D printers.
