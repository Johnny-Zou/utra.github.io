*The Mini Kossel*

The Mini Kossel is an experimental parametric delta robot 3D printer, whose design was based on a Rostock prototype. It is a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) 3D printer designed for low cost prototyping and modelling, capable of printing with various plastic materials. Since many parts of it are made from plastic and the printer can print those parts, it can be considered a self-replicating machine.

3DP's ultimate goal is to get people acquainted with 3D printing so that it becomes as normal to them as any ordinary thing! We are seeking students interested in DIY 3D printing. No prior hardware or programming experience is required. As a member of the team you will gain hands-on experience working on a Mini Kossel, among other things. This is a great opportunity for people interested in building a 3D printer from scratch. You will acquire skills and knowledge to help you get started on building your own!

UTRA has previously built two models of RepRap, "Darwin" and "Mendel", and this year we are going to put together a Mini Kossel.
