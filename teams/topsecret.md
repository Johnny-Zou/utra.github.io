**Regular Meetings**: every Thursday at 7:00 pm in BA 2135

The Top Secret Team is currently designing and building an autonomous robot capable of playing beer pong against humans. We are currently finishing up the design of our mechanical system, testing out sensors and circuitry, and planning for the construction of the main body. In a game of beer pong, the robot will sense the location of the cups using laser range finders, calculate the directions its body need to turn, and launch the ping pong ball into the cups using wheels mounted to DC motors.

It is anticipated that the beer pong robot will be all done and ready to go by Frosh Week of 2016, and will be used as a showcase for UTRA.

Some of the various tasks for the different subteams include:

**Mechanical**

- Designing the main frame and body of the robot
- Designing the servo mechanisms for turning the body and the launcher to a desired orientation
- Constructing the mechanical structure of the robot (possibly by 3D printing)

**Electrical**

- Designing and building circuits for powering and regulating the actuators and sensors
- Interfacing the circuits with a microcontroller or processor (Raspberry Pi/ Arduino)

**Software**

- Developing and implementing code for taking in sensor measurements (distances measured by the laser, etc.)
- Writing code to calculate the desired orientation in each of the robotâ€™s degree of freedom given the relative position of the cups, and calculate the correct input voltage to the motors for a launch
- Developing code which carries out the open-loop control for the launching mechanism
