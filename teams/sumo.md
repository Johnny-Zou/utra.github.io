Interested in the robotics? Not sure where to start off? Well, the Sumo team might just be the team for you!! Working on Sumo bots allowed our members to gain hands-on experience and exposed them to the electrical, mechanical and software aspects of engineering design.

Contact us via [email](mailto:sumo@utra.ca)!

UTRA developed the sumo competition to introduce new students to the mechanical, electrical, and software components of robot design. Students make their own teams of 3 and are provided with a circuit design, sensors, electrical components and example code.

The goal is to build an autonomous 10cm x 10cm robot with IR range finders to locate the opponent and light sensors to detect the edge of the ring. Two mini - sumo robots are placed in a black circular ring with a white border; the two robots try to push one another out of the ring, the last robot in the ring wins. Students use the circuit design to etch and solder their own circuit boards; they design the chassis in 3D CAD, then cut and bend the chassis from sheet metal; they write the software in C directly on the microcontroller.

UTRA hosts an autonomous mini-sumo competition at the end of the year, where the teams com pete for bragging rights amongst their peers. We organize tutorial sessions which cover most of the necessary know-how, practical and theoretical concepts required in the three areas involved:

### Electrical
- Etching Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)
- Circuit theory, electrical components
- Soldering, wire organization
- Debugging

### Embedded
- Programming microcontrollers
- Process data from sensors
- Hardware - software communication (using C)

### Mechanical
- Working with tools and machining sheet metal
- Drilling
- Cutting
- 3D CAD modeling with Solidworks
- Prototyping.



## Competition

### Why you want to be part of the Sumo Robot Competition

- Great way to enter the Robotics World

- Expand your knowledge with advanced features

- Anodizing

- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

- Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

- Will look great on your resume!!

### Competition Rules

The competition will be open only to undergraduate students of University of Toronto. In addition, a student may not compete in this competition more than once. This is to encourage students to move on to UTRA’s bigger teams.

### Arena

- The playing field will consist of a 30-inch diameter circle, finished in a non-reflective black surface with a white painted boarder and elevated 1 inch above the floor.

- When you're ready to practice, we have an arena in EA-106 that you can try your robot on.

### Design Constraints

- At the start of each round, each competing machine must be able to fit into a box with internal dimensions with a width and length of 10 cm. There is no restriction on height.

- The weight of the robot itself may not exceed 1 Kg.

- No destructive weapons allowed.

- The power supply and all control devices must be on-board.

### Match Rules

- At the start of each round, the robots will be placed on opposite sides of the platform facing in a clockwise direction (i.e., not at each other).

- The intentional dropping of objects, whether tethered or not, is forbidden.

- A robot loses by exiting the ring or being disabled

### Sumo Tutorials

You will be given three documents which will be your guide for the three major aspects of the sumo-robot:

### Setting Up Your Team

We are letting you choose your own groups and highly recommend that you get into groups of three where each person is in charge of one aspect of the sumo-robot. We recommend teams of 3, but will allow teams of 1 to 5. If your team consists of 6 or more, you will be required to divide into 2 groups. Should you find yourself covering for a role you are unfamiliar with, the tutorials will cover ALL YOU NEED to know in order to build a sumo-robot. For example, if you have no experience with electrical circuits, you'll still be able to make the circuit for the sumo-robot. The sumo competition is designed to teach you everything you need to know.

### Need a Team?

If you do not have a team, we will help – please email us as soon as possible with your name*, your discipline, and your role preference*. Including what year you are in would also be a great help to us. We prefer not to match up a group of 3rd years and then another group with only 1st years. *Don’t forget to include these parts. We will try to match you up according to your field of interest. Match up will be a first-come-first-served basis.*

### Signing Up

You can sign up your team in two ways, email us or come to our lab/office listed below. The idea here is that the earlier you sign up, the more time you have to work on your robot. In your emails please include the following:

- All names of team members

- Your respective emails

- Your respective disciplines

- Your respective roles

### Fees

We charge a nominal fee of $75 per sumo robot which covers the cost of circuits, sensors, etc. UTRA does not make any profit from this competition (quite the contrary, we generally loose money on this competition):

- For those without a team, we require $25.

- For a team, we require $75 (if you have a team with more or less than 3 people, it is still $75)

There are a limited number of sumo kits, so teams will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.

### Parts

When the parts arrive, we will e-mail all teams when parts come in for pick up at our office. We will also post a complete Sumo Robot Part List spread sheet so you know what your kit includes. We are buying everything in bulk, so you can get them cheaper from us. We are not making any money off of this. The price we buy in bulk is the price you buy from us. All the money is used for:

- Two DC motors

- All the electrical parts for the circuit (micro-controller, H-bridge, resistors, capacitors, etc.)

- One range sensor, and one light sensor

What we will not include are sheet metal, wheels, and batteries. Batteries are pretty standard, and we will sell you sheet metal depending on how much you need. The main thing that we do not decide for you is the wheels. The wheels you choose (we will not be selling any) will determine your gear ratio (speed/torque ratio) and traction. Therefore this one decision will set you apart from the other robots!
