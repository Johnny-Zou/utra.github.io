This Robonar will be more of a hands-on Robonar, where you will get the opportunity to install SolidWorks on your computer and follow along with Andrew to get a guided tutorial to using SolidWorks. It might be daunting at first, but Andrew will demystify the challenges that come about with solid modelling!

Hosted by Andrew Romano.
