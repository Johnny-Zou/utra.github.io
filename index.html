        UTRA is the face of robotics at the University of Toronto. We design and build robots to compete
        in international competitions like RoboGames and the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition, among others. We
        have five different subteams that work independently and also host talks and workshops.
        Our mission is to foster interest in robotics and teach anybody who is interested all that they need to know
        to be able to contribute.
